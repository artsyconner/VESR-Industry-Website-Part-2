        <h2>About the Industry</h2>
        <p>The media production and AI video app industries combine technology and art to make it easier to make, edit, and share videos. For instance, <strong>PrimeTime Editz</strong> is a company that works at the intersection of sports media and AI. It offers clients like ESPN automated video editing and delivery services while still maintaining a high level of quality. To make interesting, professional visual stories from raw footage, the media production and AI video software industries rely on new ideas, automation, and collaboration.</p>

            <h2>My Role at PrimeTime Editz</h2>
            <p>I am in charge of the team at <strong>PrimeTime Editz</strong> as the <strong>IT Support and Creative Director</strong>. To do my job, I need to know a lot about technology and be able to think creatively. I am in charge of uploading and keeping all of those movie files safe and up to date. I also make sure that every project is processed quickly and safely through the systems and database.</p>

            <p>As the Creative Director, I write a full description of each client's wants and needs prior to any work being started at all. Based on the client's explanations, I establish the creative vision, style, and AI-improvement outcomes for the project. Every project proposal is being submitted for review to ascertain whether it meets the needs of the client or protocols set forth by PrimeTime Editz for quality assurance. The result is either Approved or Declined/Rejected.</p>

            <p>I continue to follow the project through to delivery while ensuring all work meets brand standards, creative benchmarks, and technical accuracy; thereby bridging the creative and IT capacities of the company to facilitate seamlessly high-impact video content.</p>

            <h2>Ethical Issue</h2>
            <p>An ethical issue that could arise in my position is the <strong>misuse of AI enhancement tools</strong>. With AI-driven editing, there’s potential for altering footage in ways that misrepresent individuals or events. As the Creative Director, I must ensure our AI tools are used transparently and ethically, maintaining honesty and artistic integrity in every project we produce.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Client footage, scripts, and metadata stored in cloud systems could be targeted by cybercriminals, exposing sensitive creative materials and contracts.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware or Phishing Attacks:</strong> Staff handling uploads and client communications could accidentally open malicious links or attachments, leading to encrypted files and halted production.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypt all video uploads, client data, and communication channels.</li>
                <li>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for account access.</li>
                <li>Regularly back up projects and secure them in offline or encrypted cloud storage.</li>
                <li>Provide ongoing staff training on phishing, ransomware, and digital hygiene.</li>
                <li>Update software and firewalls frequently to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
